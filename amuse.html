        <h2>Site One: Random Cat Generator</h2>
    </body>
    <p>This website literally just generates pictures<br>
      of random cats and you can click a button that says <br>
    "Get a cat!" and it will give you a new picture of a different cat </p>
          <a href= "https://genrandom.com/cats/"> Check Me out! ;)</a>
  <h2>Site 2: Archive of Our Own</h2>
    <p>Archive of Our Own or Ao3 is a website <br>
      where people can write, publish, and read stories. <br>
      They range from incredibly original to works of fanfiction.</p> <br>
            <a href= "https://archiveofourown.org//"> Check Me out! ;)</a>
            <h2>Site 3: Duck Life</h2>
    <p> Duck Life is an online game where you train <br>
      and raise a duck to race in triathlons against other ducks. <br>
      You can find it on a bunch of different sites but I prefered Cool Math Games.</p> <br>
          <a href= "https://www.coolmathgames.com/0-duck-life#immersiveModal"> Check Me out! ;)</a>
