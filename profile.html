    <p>Hello, I'm a graphic design major with a certification in digital marketing.<br>
      I love to write, read, and create things in any sort of artistic way. I've <br>
      really gotten into jewelry making and print making lately. I love to travel<br>
      and I've been to thirteen different countries outside of the US and cannot wait<br>
      to see more of the world. </p>
